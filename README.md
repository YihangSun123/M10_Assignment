Step 3. Update the script that was provided to remove the blank row in the csv output file.

Step 4. commit the changes to my script the master branch of my GitHub repository


Part 2:

I am going to alter the script, M10_webscraper_assignment.ipybn, to iterate through the pagination that exists on the page and compile all of the results in one dataframe from each page. 
Once I have done that, I should follow the same procedures in (2) to load the full csv file into the s3 bucket. 
Once the test has passed, commit the changes to the master branch of my GitHub repository, updating the script and the file on s3.  
Submitting the Assignment.
